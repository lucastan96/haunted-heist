# haunted-heist
Haunted Heist is a fun mini text-based game created using C++ and Xcode!

This project is inspired from a very popular text-based game from the 80s named Zork. All gameplay of Haunted Heist is console based.

Haunted Heist is a pair project with me and my classmates & friend Alvin. The objective of this project is to practice our skills of coding in C++, which includes the implementation of advanced concepts such as inheritance and pointers.

# The Story
You are standing outside a dark & creepy house that's rumored to be haunted.
Your goal is to navigate the house and steal the treasure hidden in the house, probably protected by ghosts?

Do not be afraid, as you came prepared! You have your very own specially designed vacuum machine and some batteries to protect yourself, along with a backpack to store stuff!
